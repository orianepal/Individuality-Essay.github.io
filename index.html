<h1> Introduction </h1>

<br><br>






<h2>


Throughout several decades and centuries, the exchange of goods is at the core of our society and civilization age. We have grown more and more into centering all our activities and life purposes around the possession of commodities.
</h2>
<h2>
Particularly from the 1950s and 1960s, the start of mass production lead to mass consumption and a new way of living emerged : commodities became part of the identity of our society and its individuals. Since then, we define ourselves through what we own.
</h2>
<h2>
Today in the Digital Age, our technological improvements and the ways we acquire new goods has diversified and the stimulation towards potential buyers is constant. We are bombarded by targeted advertising, privacy cookies we blindly accept, terms and conditions we do not read, all of which has to do with the collection of our data. In this information-driven society, data is the most powerful asset there is. The collection and analysis of information about users, consumers is crucial to our current economy, the society and its individuals. We are in a evermore consuming society, in which we trade data and information as its new commodities, whether it means to breach the society’s individual’s trust, power and identity.
<br>
I aim to question the ways we contextualize ever existing subjects such as consumption and possession of goods in the digital age and what are the current ethical challenges that we face in regards to questions of privacy and data mining, and what are their consequences at the level of the individual, and its perception of its own individuality and identity.

<br><span class="reference1">The idea of being in a society ruled by commodity is described by Guy Debord throughout “The Society of the Spectacle” in 1967. He noted the transformation of human relationships into objectified self-interested relations, and defined the Spectacle itself essentially as the total domination of the society by commodity.</span> Debord elaborates on the ideas that we define ourselves through what we own, with consumerism as our only drive in life. Mass production leading to mass consumption is what our economy is based on, and the Spectacle would be a representation through images of that society.
<br>Particularly in the United States, <span class="reference0">the mindset of individuals turned into a very materialistic one, drawn upon buying and possessing goods, so much so that this emerging trend gave the society its new identity : The Consumer Society.</span> This phenomenon and newly worship devoted to commodities was reflected upon by artists, first as a celebration, later as a criticism : Pop Art appeared in the 1950s in England, and later experienced a real boom in the United States, embracing the simplicity and introducing objects of everyday life (commodities) into fine arts. The idea of consumerism still undeveloped in Europe, overseas artists took a much more critical stance on the attitudes towards Consumerism on a more global scale. 
<br><br>

Although written half a century ago, the thesis of the book resonate deeply with our contemporary society, and what Debord described as an alienated society devoting its purpose to the existence of the Spectacle and revolving around commodities has been greatly enhanced by the rise of Internet and the Digital Age we are currently living in.
<br>
<span class="reference2">Almost everything that is described by Debord can be transposed to our current context : I imagine the Spectacle to be the digital world, which was often held accountable for our social division.</span> <span class="reference01">It also has its own organisations and individuals</span> : <span class="reference3">each of us would have our own digital persona, and all the data we produce from our credit cards, online communication, social media feeds, etc.. creates its own greater organisation as a representation of the real world and its exchanges, but also a representation of the society’s individuals. Our online and digital activity leaves a mark that ultimately created our digital profile, identity.</span> Everything I’ve used the Internet for, whether it is for sharing pictures on Facebook, applying for a job, buying something, constitutes our online presence and existence in the Spectacle, our identity within it as our online persona. The data that is generated by our actions is our digital footprint in the Spectacle.
<br><br>
What Guy Debord describes as a place in which <span class="reference4">our isolation is maintained from one-another can also be perceived from the point of view of mass production, linked to the industrial age and later on the technological progresses that lead to the digital age, with even more production and better distribution of the goods.</span> <span class="reference5">When buying commodities, we only need to interact with a brand : the image of a product. The previous steps of primary workers, producers, distributors and salesmen are a hidden process for us consumers, which is a loss for individuality and sense of community, and rather leaves us with a taste of mechanic and standardisation of our needs and products</span>, and quoting Debord, “maintains [our] isolation from one another.”
<br>
The Spectacle is the relationship among people that is mediated by images, in other words, we relate to each other based on the products we consume and individualism is demonstrated through the brands we wear. The Digital Age didn't take away the need for us to have physical objects and be evermore materialistic, but it brought the dematerialisation of the transaction : On one hand, the experience of buying goods is not quite an experience anymore. It can take a few clicks on our computer mouse, or taps on our phone screens and what we wished for will be delivered at our doorsteps. On the other hand, like described above, what we have left from the whole chain of production is the image of a product, a brand. <span class="reference6">The advertisement of those brands and the constant stimuli of images towards the consumer is something strongly criticized by Debord already back in the 1960s, and what he describes as the basis of the alienation of the Spectators.</span> At the time, advertisement was seen on TV screens, billboards, magazines, etc… and already felt like being surrounded by images at all times. Today, we feel just as bombarded by images, especially considering the expansion that advertising has experienced with digital platforms in the last decades. This expansion came with a very important new asset, that would allow companies to become very profitable and influential : online data.

<h1>How do commodities translate to abstract plain data - The role of AI in our current society </h1>

<br><br>

<h2>


<div class="refbox" style="position: absolute; top:40%; right:-560px; width:530px; height: 235px"> <h5> Manovich, Lev. <i>AI Aesthetics</i>. Strelka Press, 2018. </h5> </div>

<div style="position: absolute; top:42%; right:-430px;"> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Fh0TXpWdU9HxHXoCDIW2TFht-CWV-bEF" target="_blank" > <img src="ref/Screenshot 2020-06-21 at 22.56.36.png" id="draggable05" class="work" style="width: 300px; border: 1px solid white" > </a> </div>



Being in a society driven by consumerism will automatically make our “needs” and “choices” biased. TV, social media and pretty much any platform we interact with on a daily basis are riddled with advertisement, all of which has been thought out to get specific information about the consumer and its satisfaction, which is key to the growth of the economy.
<br>
<span class="reference7">On internet, cookies can target our interests through our personal data and pretty much determine for us what our “needs” are, predict what we want to buy as a result, and show us advertisement for it. Things we consider as being of our own free will always have roots in things that happened to us. But what happened to us is determined by algorithms mostly.</span>
<br>
For any organisation or company, the most important information lies in the following questions : What do people want ? What have they bought before? Were they satisfied with it ? Why or why not ? All of these answers can be very easily found, whether it is through Google searches, customer service insights, online ratings and reviews, social media promoting, etc… Which makes our online activity footprints very valuable. Considering that everything we do online (sometimes also offline) leaves a trace, we know how easy it is to be labelled and targeted for any company to look for high chance potential buyers.
<br>
In that way, we can say that the commodities that define who I am, are turned into a flow of data in several ways : <span class="reference7">when purchased online, I will need to fill out a whole lot of information in order to buy a product : email address, name, phone number, postal address, credit card information, etc.. all of which generates an important amount of valuable data, which will be used later on by the algorithms to better understand me, my needs, my desires, and predict new purchases. But AI doesn’t only influence on the products I might buy. Today, it has such a far better reach in terms of influencing our culture, we can argue that it could alter our global potential for creativity and imagination.</span>
<br><br>
If most of what I identify myself as and what I think created my personality/history/habits has been induced through algorithms (ads, recommendations, etc..), then we are only the product of this algorithm and of whoever programmed it. 
We are no longer individual people with our own identities, we become objects labelled into groups that have been recognized to have similar patterns on our online activity. 
<br>
Of course, there is also a use for data that benefits us the consumers. Data is used to improve services such as online platforms, applications that deliver content to us. If Debord was criticizing cable TV, we now have a much more elaborate equivalent : Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu, etc… all of which use data to improve their suggestions and overall operating system to meet their subscribers’ needs and desires. Data could also be used for communal services, like car sharing. If we all shared our data concerning our commute to and from work or different occupations, we would probably be able to determine how many cars a whole city needs, and theoretically be able to design and develop a car sharing service that would benefit everybody in terms of costs and practicality (we wouldn’t need a car for ourselves and the costs that it might bring, no need for designated parking spots as the cars are always in use), but also the city (lots of space is liberated due to a lesser need of parking spaces and roads), and ultimately the planet (a tremendously positive impact on the environment would ensue). 
<br>
So what does it cost to come up with such service ? On a technological level, we can expect that AI will progress and give us the opportunity to get even more tailored services with better “judgement” of how to do so. The technology is and will be there, but are we willing to trade these great services for our privacy ?
<br><br>
An important question of trust towards the people or entities managing the data must be raised. During the coronavirus pandemic, countries such as China, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have used the help of device-tracking systems to monitor the propagation of the virus. In most cases mandatory, the app tracks the mobility of infected individuals and warns people who have had close contact with them. However, these city tracing systems allow authorities to have access to otherwise inaccessible data such as security camera footages and credit card transactions. This raises a lot of questions and concerns towards the population being tracked down and their authorities, whether we can really trust them to make use of data for specific emergency situations, and that they remain temporary, as well as the right for them to breach the privacy of the population.
<br>
If people trust the authorities and scientific data over unfounded conspiracy theories and self-serving politicians, we might be able to serve a global purpose of avoiding difficult situations like the fast spreading of the coronavirus.
At the same time, how do we trust that our sacrifices of our privacy will be in good hands ? What are the risks ? After all, the use of data makes tailored services way more enjoyable for us, and why should I care if a company knows about my consumption of series or movies on Netflix, or what I buy on Amazon ? Or the places I go, the way I spend my money ?
The truth is that the consequences of our sole existence in the Digital Spectacle can sometimes go as far as to take away basic human rights, or at least question the way we get to have them.

</h2>

<br><br><br>

<h1>How much of who we are has been decided for us ?</h1>

<br><br>

<h2>

Our sole existence in the Digital Spectacle is now devoted to generating data and refining the giant datasets that label and target us as different consumers. Like in Guy Debord’s thesis, our existence is what keeps the Spectacle alive, just like our constant flow of generated data keeps the systems ruling our economy and general organisation going. Not only does it enable our society to function, it has also given its new identity and a new cultural classification system, that each individual is defined by. Being part of this Spectacle is mandatory to function in our society, any conscious choice of going “off the grid” becomes an extreme statement of disconnection towards our current society, and requires them to give up on what is seen as a “normal” life. 
<br>While any “normal” Spectator might not mind the slight influences that data might have on a personal level, for example not seeing the direct consequences, some aspects need to be brought to light, as for the concept of free will an what might be lost in the data trade.
We might argue that the Spectacle can’t force us to click on a banner when we see an add, and that ultimately, we are still in control of what we choose to purchase/browse through. In addition to that, we do not see the direct consequences of our data being collected and therefore do not feel affected by it. “I don’t care if my data is being collected and people make money off of me, it’s not my money anyway” is something I have heard and shows that despite being aware of the reliance of the society’s economy around data doesn’t necessarily mean that we care about it or about our privacy being infringed. I think that something that is not being considered enough is that although it might seem so, advertisement and leisure services are not the direct threat for privacy but only the medium with which the real concerns get through to us.
<br>One fundamental aspect of Guy Debord’s theory and voiced solution against the Spectacle’s enslavement with commodity is democracy. Now I think it is particularly striking to see that still today, what really is at stakes with the data trade is the notion of individuality and of being able to voice our own desires, express our heartfelt concerns and general consciousness and free will to act upon human rights infringements, in other words, democracy. An example that brings light to these concerns would be the recent famous case of Cambridge Analytica, that makes pretty clear how data mining can be a threat for our identity, individuality and ultimately for democracy.

<br><br>In the Cambridge Analytica case, we have been shown how what we think as private information can be used to get through to us on a very deep level - perhaps deeper than we can control. Although we are not really able to determine the extent of influence these methods have on us - which is part of why it’s so efficient - we can see how our own data can and will be used for more than targeted advertising. In the case of the 2016 American presidential elections, Cambridge Analytica used an application to collect and analyse the data which consisted of a series of questions to build psychological profiles on millions of Facebook users. The company thereby managed to build psychological profiles in the aim of influencing their opinions through political advertising. As a result, the data of 87 million users were collected and analysed, while only 270,000 had downloaded the app.
<br>It is difficult to say what exactly is effective in this case and if the changes in people’s behaviour are directly linked to Cambridge Analytica’s type of action, because it is done in such a way that makes it invisible to the targeted individual : the person sees and registers information (promoted articles, advertisement, how content is displayed on a feed), but expresses it later as a change in his/her personality or point of view, which can make us question the legitimacy of our own thoughts and whether we are responsible for who we are. By answering a few questions, Cambridge Analytica was able to elaborate detailed profiles and determine the user and its Facebook friends’ political opinions, and target them if necessary to swing towards a particular candidate by showing influential content. The results of the questionnaire could predict "needs" of subjects and how these needs may change over time, in a so-called "behavioral microtargeting". Depending on the group you were labeled in, you would then be shown content, advertisement, different feed hierarchy that would be thought out to be the most effective in changing your behaviour towards the campaign.
<br>Drifting away from the Cambridge Analytica case in which the use of our data to change a target group’s political opinion is pretty straightforward, data is today’s most valuable asset, and the key to a successful business. The tech giants - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft - deal with billions of users’ data to operate, and can probably establish a digital profile so accurate that we would learn about our own selves, and not the other way around. With data, you are able to determine someone’s desires, interests, habits, etc… and even predict how these parameters change for an individual. This not only gives the power and riches to a few very few individuals, but raises questions towards the meaning of our individuality and the impact one can have over such titan companies. 
<br>Our democracy is at stake : while we might not care about clicking once on an advertisement and therefore giving a certain level of information to an invisible entity, the indirect effects of millions of consumers clicking could make a single person so rich and powerful to influence the course of a political election, for example. Give a company enough money, and they will look into millions of users’ data to find out about their weaknesses and doubts, and research the right way to have an impact on their decision making. What if governments had access to this data and were able to use it not only for political stances but to change people’s behaviour, ultimately modelling their identities to what they think will benefit them most.
<br> The real challenges still lie on the consciousness and frame of action that people can still have, and how we want to take action in order to preserve our sense of community and rightfulness, being able to claim our basic human rights like democracy, the right to live and to be considered an element of the society with its own identity, needs and free will.
